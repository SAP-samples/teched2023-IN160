# Discover, design and run pre-built standard integrations on Edge Integration Cell

In the previous exercise we have Activated and deployed an Edge Integration Cell, let's look at how we can Discover, design and run pre-built Standard Integrations on Edge Integration Cell. In this exercise we will use a pre-built standard content to connect to S/4 HANA backend system, trigger execution of the content deployed at Edge Integration Cell and perform operations like update of the S/4 data objects.

##  Description

After completing these steps you will have deployed a Standard Integration on Edge Integration Cell and successfully executed it with On-Premise S/4 HANA system.
