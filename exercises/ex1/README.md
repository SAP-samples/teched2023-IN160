First section is the **Recent Activities & Monitoring**, which gives you a snapshot of what´s going on with the SAP Integration Suite tenant. It lists the artifacts that were worked upon and also the monitoring status of the deployed artifacts. You can navigate to them directly from here.

Now if you look at the different navigation sections on the left, after **Home**, you will see **Discover**, which is a repository of all standard pre-built content (integrations, APIs and type systems) shipped by SAP. Based on your specific integration need, you can explore, search and copy them to your **Design** workspace to kick-start your integration development.

**Design** is your local workspace where you can design and configure integrations, APIs, message implementation guidelines, mapping guidelines, scripts and other integration artifacts.

In the **Monitor** section, you can check the deployment status, look at message processing logs, manage security materials, data stores, message queues and all that you need to monitor and operate your integrations across multiple runtimes.

**Inspect** enables you to assess the overall resource situation of the tenant, like identifying hotspots, breakdown of resource consumed by each integration flow, resource usage trends.

You can use **Monetize** to define rate plans for the API Products that you build and check the API usage pattern. The in-built billing engine also generates the bills for you, which can be accessed across multiple channels.

If you have Tenant Admin role assigned, you will be able to access **Settings**. Here you can configure settings which are applicable for the entire tenant like managing runtime profiles, configuring transport management, setting up API Management, customization of MIGs & MAGs, etc.

<br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/Settings-Integrations.jpg)<br><br><br>


Under **Settings - Runtime**, you will be able to activate or deactivate "Edge Integration Cell" and for this you need to have "Integration_Provisioner" role assigned to your user. Once "Edge Integration Cell" is activated, you will get a URL to navigate to "Edge Lifecycle Management", which is required to setup and deploy Edge Integration Cell to your kubernetes cluster. To access "Edge Lifecycle Management", you will need "EdgeLMAccess" role.
